# L2R Name transcriptor - Frontend

This repository contains the basic frontend for the [L2R Name transcriptor](https://github.com/EvgeniPolyakov/Latin-to-Russian-name-transcriptor), a tool for converting proper name spellings from various Latin-script using languages into Russian. The frontend is built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript and communicates with the back-end API to provide a simple and intuitive interface for using the transcription tool.

End result in its current state can be found [here](http://l2rfrontend-env.eba-jyypjt3v.eu-north-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/).

With the frontend, users can input a proper name in one of three conventional character cases: lower case, Title case, or ALLCAPS. Mixed case input will be automatically cast to Title case. The transcription result will be displayed on the page, with the option to copy it to the clipboard.

Please note that this frontend is a basic implementation and additional features and improvements may be added in the future. The goal is to provide a simple and straightforward way to use the L2R Name transcriptor.
