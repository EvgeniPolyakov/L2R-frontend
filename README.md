# L2R Name transcriptor - Frontend

This repository contains the basic frontend for
the [L2R Name transcriptor](https://github.com/EvgeniPolyakov/Latin-to-Russian-name-transcriptor), a tool for converting
proper name spellings from various Latin-script using languages into Russian. The frontend is built using HTML, CSS and
JavaScript and communicates with the back-end API to provide a simple and intuitive interface for using the
transcription tool.

End result in its current state can be
found [here](http://l2rfrontend-env.eba-jyypjt3v.eu-north-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/).

Users can input a proper name in one of three conventional character cases: lower case, Title case, or ALLCAPS. Mixed
case input will be automatically cast to Title case. The transcription result will be displayed on the page with the
option to copy it to the clipboard.

This is a basic implementation of frontend and additional features and improvements may be added in the future. The goal
is to provide a simple and straightforward way to use
the [L2R Name transcriptor](https://github.com/EvgeniPolyakov/Latin-to-Russian-name-transcriptor).
